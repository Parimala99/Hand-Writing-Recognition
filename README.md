# Hand-Writing-Recognition
Building a machine learning model to identify handwritten digits.
In recent years, handwritten digit recognition has proven to be a difficult task. Many real-world scenarios necessitate the classification of handwritten text or numbers. Digit recognition is used in postal mail sorting, bank check processing, form data entry, and other applications. Images of scaled segments from five-digit ZIP codes make up the raw data.
In this project ,  We are going to recognize handwritten digits(0â€“9). These images are gray scale images and the dataset can be loaded from scikit learn library in the module datasets.
To recognize the images or data , I am going to use Support vectors classification model with parameters C=100 and gamma = 0.01. I am going to perform 3 different cases , where for each case I am going to change the size of training data and see the accuracy of the model.
